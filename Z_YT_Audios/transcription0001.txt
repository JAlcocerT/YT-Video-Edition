And you just need to be aware, yeah, on how to call it, client.chat.completions.create. And you have the system part, the user prompt, so, yeah, you can tweak it and see how it works to, yeah, to be our Streamlit Python Assistant, right? Here it is, really concise to the point, and, yeah, I'm sure this application works. So, yeah, and as mentioned, this is going to be the base ground for this repository that I will be explaining on future videos, right? We are just seeing the API calls, but there are a few more that we will cover, as well as GitHub actions and so on. But, yeah, to the point, let's see other use case of OpenAI API. Now we are going to do transcription, right? We are going to do text-to-audio, speech-to-text, right? They call it. So, simply, I have modified a little bit the code so that we just read from a TXT file instead of having input text hard-coded on the script. So given this transcription.txt, which I was using it from the audio of my Cloudflare video before, let's just tweak it a little bit so that it's not totally the same. Yeah, just write something. And then we are going to see how simple it is to generate that audio, right? And I'm sure that, well, the voice is quite familiar to you, is the one, yeah, that I'm using for all of these videos, right? So...
